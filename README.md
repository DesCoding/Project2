# Puppy Love

    - https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/random API to pull pictures, personality traits/bio, specs (maybe size, weight, energy level, life expectancy)

        - user create account with user name, password, select pet preferences (drop down menues from Pet Finder API fed table)

        - need API call to search by user preferences
            API data captured in pet info database
            user data capturedin user info database

        - work passport first

        
    use hammer.js for swipe feature (one new technology)

Project requirements:

    schema database to store user preferences and user account info.
        Users create profile with preferences.  When they sign in, dogs offered match with user preferences.

    seeds - test options

    must use node, express web server, handlebars

    Get and Post routes, MySql, Sequelize ORM

    deploy to Heroku

    polished front end

    MVC folder structure

    Use petfinder.com
    protect API key (call it through node rather than in JS file).  Is this open to public?  

    Future Development Ideas:
    - youtube results for recommended breed
    - link to nearby rescue shelters if matching breeds are available
    - aggression or breed filter
    - care instructions for each breed
    - users able to change preferences after initial setting
    - hammer.js
    - posts from users
